First off we wanted to tackle the mode issue, figuring out the mode of the array
MODE
    - We decided to keep a map to have a list of key-value pairs to sort the mode
      and see which stories correspond to which frequency.
    - Then we return either a mode or a -1 indicating there is no mode in this set

DISPLAY stories
    - Depending on our mode we display the number of stories to console
    - If no mode is found display five stories
    - Otherwise display each story that has the same frequency

READ FILE
    - using the info stream, get the metadata for each story and store it in an array of 
      story structs.
