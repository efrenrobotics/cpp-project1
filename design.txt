First off we wanted to tackle the mode issue, figuring out the mode of the array
MODE
    - We decided to keep a map to have a list of key-value pairs to sort the mode
      and see which stories correspond to which frequency.
    - Then we return either a mode or a -1 indicating there is no mode in this set

DISPLAY stories
    - Depending on our mode we display the number of stories to console
    - If no mode is found display five stories, if there is less than five
      stories in the file, display all the stories
    - Otherwise display each story that has the same score as the mode

READ FILE
    - using the info stream, get the metadata for each story and store it in an array of 
      story structs.

g++ instagram.cpp -o insta  

./insta stories
./insta stories2
./insta stories3
./insta stories4
./insta stories5
